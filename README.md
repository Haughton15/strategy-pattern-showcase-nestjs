## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The project aimed to demonstrate the implementation of the Strategy design pattern within a NestJS application, showcasing a practical approach to software design and development. The Strategy pattern, a behavioral design pattern, allows the definition of a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one and making them interchangeable. This pattern lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it, promoting a more flexible and maintainable code structure.

In the context of NestJS, a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications, the Strategy pattern was applied to create a modular and easily adaptable application structure. The project focused on a use case where different strategies for processing user data could be required, such as different validation, sorting, or filtering algorithms, depending on the context or user preferences.

The implementation began with defining a common strategy interface to outline the operations that all concrete strategies must implement. This interface ensures that each strategy adheres to a specific structure, making them interchangeable within the application's ecosystem. Next, several concrete strategy classes were developed, each implementing the strategy interface and providing a unique algorithm for handling user data.

By implementing the Strategy pattern in a NestJS application, this project highlighted how design patterns could be effectively used to solve common software development challenges, promoting better code organization, flexibility, and scalability.
